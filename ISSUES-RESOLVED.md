# Couple Chat App – Issues Resolved ✅

This document tracks every problem that surfaced during the debugging session and the concrete action taken to get the Couple Chat App back to a fully-working state.

| # | Area | Issue / Symptom | Fix Applied | Status |
|---|------|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Security / Front-end deps | Critical vulnerabilities in `next` (`npm audit` reported SSRF, DoS, auth-bypass) | Upgraded **next** from `14.0.4` to **14.2.30** via `npm audit fix --force` | ✔️ Patched |
| 2 | Backend runtime | Port **5000**/ **5001** already occupied (EADDRINUSE) | • Picked dedicated backend port **3001**  <br>• Updated `backend/.env` `PORT=3001` <br>• Adjusted front-end `.env.local` (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`) to `http://localhost:3001/api` | ✔️ Server starts reliably |
| 3 | CORS | Front-end requests blocked, “Not allowed by CORS” & 500 responses | Implemented robust `corsOptions` in `backend/app.js`:  <br>• Whitelist from `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`/`FRONTEND_URL`  <br>• Auto-allow any `localhost:*` in dev  <br>• Proper headers, methods, credentials & explicit `OPTIONS` handler | ✔️ CORS tests pass |
| 4 | Regex bug | Invalid RegExp flags `\\` in CORS localhost test → backend crashed | Simplified regex to `/^https?:\/\/localhost(?::\d+)?$/` | ✔️ Crash eliminated |
| 5 | Env naming | Controllers expected `JWT_EXPIRE` but env file had `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | Normalised to `JWT_EXPIRE` in `authController.js` and `.env` | ✔️ Token expiry functions |
| 6 | Auth context | Mixed usage `req.user.userId` vs `req.userId` breaking profile / change-pw routes | Standardised **middleware** to set `req.userId` and updated all controller references | ✔️ Auth routes stable |
| 7 | JWT middleware | Missing 401 JSON shape | Added consistent JSON response `{ error: 'Please authenticate' }` | ✔️ Predictable errors |
| 8 | Gemini AI service | Hard-coded model & no HTTP error surfacing | • Accepted `GEMINI_MODEL` env  <br>• Built dynamic endpoint URL  <br>• Threw descriptive errors on non-2xx | ✔️ AI features stable |
| 9 | Dependency hygiene | `uuid` missing for test utilities | Installed `uuid` dev dep | ✔️ Tests compile |
|10 | Logging & Health | No simple health probe; hard to verify container readiness | Added `/api/health` endpoint and minimal request logging middleware | ✔️ Ops friendly |
|11 | .env files | Absent / outdated env examples | Created current `backend/.env` & `.env.example`, updated `.env.local` (front-end) | ✔️ Clear setup |
|12 | Front-end API | Hard-coded to old port 5000 causing 404/CORS | Refreshed `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to match new backend port | ✔️ SPA connects |
|13 | Automated QA | No regression check | Authored **`test-functionality.js`**: health, CORS, signup/login, chat, messaging. All tests pass. | ✔️ CI ready |
|14 | Analytics endpoints | “Class constructor ObjectId cannot be invoked without 'new'” → 500 errors on `/analytics/*` | Replaced legacy `mongoose.Types.ObjectId(id)` with `new mongoose.Types.ObjectId(id)` and fixed aggregation keys in **`analyticsController.js`** | ✔️ Analytics OK |
|15 | AI controller | Unguarded Gemini calls gave 400 API-key errors | Added `isAIServiceAvailable` check & `handleAIServiceError` helper in **`aiController.js`** for friendly fallback when key/model missing | ✔️ Graceful fallback |

## Current Application Status 🌟

1. **Backend** runs on **http://localhost:3001** – MongoDB connected, health endpoint green.  
2. **Front-end** served by Next.js on **http://localhost:3000**, consumes the API without CORS errors.  
3. Critical security advisories resolved; `npm audit` shows **0 vulnerabilities**.  
4. All major user journeys verified by automated script:  
   • Sign-up / Login (JWT)  
   • Chat creation & retrieval  
   • Message send / fetch with pagination  
   • Analytics dashboards render without 500s  
   • CORS acceptance for allowed origins, rejection for malicious ones  
5. AI endpoints are guarded: missing/invalid Gemini credentials return clear 4xx messages instead of 500 crashes.

The Couple Chat App is **fully functional** and ready for further feature development or deployment. 🚀
